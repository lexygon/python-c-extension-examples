**About Repository**
This repo will host some examples for "writing C extensions for Python 3.x".
Our first example is calculator. It has 4 basit arithmetic functions. 
You can find all of comments in the files. I tried to explain what is happening line by line.

**Example Structrue**
One or more ".c, .h etc." files that contains C extension codes.
A setup.py file that contains installing codes and parameters.
An sample.py file that shows how to use that extension.

**How Can I Install And Try the Extension Examples ?**
1- Create a virtualenv.(*Optional**) 
2- Go to the project directory and run "python setup.py install"
3- Check the sample.py for learning how to use the extension.
That's it !

**Can you help me ?**
If you have some example ideas or you know how to write C extension for Python, please help me and commit some examples or updates.
